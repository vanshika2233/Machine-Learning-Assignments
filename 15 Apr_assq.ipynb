    "Load the dataset into variables X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test. These variables should contain the training and testing data split. Define the indices of numerical and categorical features in the dataset. Define two separate pipelines, one for numerical features and another for categorical features. In the numerical pipeline, missing values are imputed with the mean of the column values and then scaled using standardization. In the categorical pipeline, missing values are imputed with the most frequent value of the column and then one-hot encoded. Combine the two pipelines using a ColumnTransformer that applies each pipeline to the respective feature columns. Apply feature selection using SelectFromModel with a RandomForestClassifier as the estimator. This step will select the most important features from the dataset. Create the final pipeline by combining the preprocessor, feature selector, and a RandomForestClassifier as the final estimator. Fit the pipeline on the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the testing data. Possible Improvements:\n",

Use other types of models besides a RandomForestClassifier to see if they provide better results. Try different hyperparameters for the models to see if they improve the accuracy of the model."
