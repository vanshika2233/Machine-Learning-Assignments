    "\n",
    "Traditional web hosting involves leasing server space from a hosting provider and managing the server hardware and software yourself. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, involves renting virtual servers, storage, and other resources from a cloud provider like AWS or Azure. In cloud hosting, the provider takes care of server maintenance and management, and users can scale resources up or down as needed.\n"

    "\n",
    "To integrate the machine learning model with the user interface for the Algerian Forest Fires project, you can use APIs or libraries such as Flask, Django, or FastAPI. These tools allow you to build a web API that connects the frontend user interface to the machine learning model. You can also use libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow to train and deploy the machine learning model. Finally, you can use a web-based visualization library such as D3.js or Plotly to create interactive visualizations of the model's predictions.\n",
