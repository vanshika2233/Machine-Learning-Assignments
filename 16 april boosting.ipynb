    "\n",
    "**Positive Effects:**\n",
    "1. **Improved Training Accuracy:** Generally, increasing the number of estimators can lead to better training accuracy. This is because each additional weak learner is trained to correct errors made by the previous ones, resulting in a more accurate overall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Generalization:** A larger number of estimators can improve the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. This is especially beneficial when the model is not overfitting the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Effects:**\n",
    "1. **Overfitting:** There's a risk of overfitting the training data if the number of estimators becomes excessively large. The model may start memorizing the training instances, capturing noise in the data and performing poorly on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Increased Computational Cost:** Training additional weak learners requires more computational resources and time. As the number of estimators grows, the training process becomes more computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diminishing Returns:** Beyond a certain point, adding more estimators may provide diminishing returns in terms of performance improvement. The gains in accuracy may become marginal, and the algorithm may start fitting the noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common practice to perform model selection techniques, such as cross-validation, to find the optimal number of estimators that balances improved performance without overfitting. Monitoring the performance on a validation set or using early stopping criteria can help prevent the model from continuing to train after it has reached its optimal point.\n",
